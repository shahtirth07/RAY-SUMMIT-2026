# serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py
#
# OPTIMIZED deployment for 1x NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 (96 GB Blackwell, AWS g7e.4xlarge), TP=1.
# Serves the 4-bit NVFP4 weight checkpoint (nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4) — the validated coding-agent default:
# NVFP4 weights + FP8 KV + full 256K context (6.53× concurrency), CUDA graphs, MTP speculative decoding, and
# (for the no-MTP path) the prebuilt compile cache. NVFP4 weights are ~22 GB (vs FP8 ~27 GB), freeing KV
# headroom; they run the Marlin (non-native) FP4 path on SM120 (no dense-NVFP4 SM120 kernel in vLLM yet:
# vllm#31085 / #33417 cover MoE only). The checkpoint is a vision-language model and serves image input
# (verified on RTX PRO 6000 / vLLM 0.23.0). Every optimization is a toggle in the CONTROL PANEL.
# Full measurements + the "knobs that can't be combined" matrix:
# notes/BENCHMARKS.md / notes/INCOMPATIBILITIES.md.
#
# STACK: ray-llm 2.57.0 / vLLM 0.25.1 (Containerfile). Except for the compile cache (knob 2, rebuilt and
# re-measured on 0.25.1), the numbers below were measured on vLLM 0.22.0-0.23.0 under ray-llm 2.56.0 and
# have NOT been re-validated — see notes/BENCHMARKS.md "Revalidation on vLLM 0.25.1" for what to re-run.
# The one behavior change the upgrade brings is the prefix router (knob 6): ray#64328 makes the stock
# router work under direct streaming, so the DirectStreamingPrefixCacheRouter adapter this repo carried
# is gone.

# ════════════════════════════════ OPTIMIZATION CONTROL PANEL ════════════════════════════════
# Flip each ON/OFF. Mutually-exclusive combos are flagged with ⚠ (and enforced by a guard below).

# (0) NVFP4 WEIGHTS — use NVIDIA's ~22 GB 4-bit checkpoint instead of the ~27 GB FP8 checkpoint.
#     ON is the RTX PRO 6000 default. Turn OFF for the FP8 baseline or for older FP8-capable GPUs such as
#     Hopper H100. This changes model weights only; FP8 KV cache is controlled independently by knob 3.
#     ⚠ The prebuilt compile cache is NVFP4-specific, so turning this OFF also disables knob 2.
ENABLE_NVFP4_WEIGHTS = True

# (1) FAST MODEL LOADING — optional cold-start path, not the default. RunAI Streamer streams the selected
#     checkpoint from S3 -> GPU (~85s -> ~25s cold start). Needs runai-model-streamer in the image
#     (Containerfile) + cluster S3 read access. Validated on RTX PRO 6000 / vLLM 0.23.0.
#     ⚠ Mutually exclusive with ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE (vllm#42060). To opt into fast loading instead of MTP
#     decode speed, set:
#       ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE = False
#       ENABLE_FAST_MODEL_LOADING = True
ENABLE_FAST_MODEL_LOADING = False

# (2) COMPILE CACHE — download the prebuilt inductor + AOT torch.compile caches from S3 so a cold replica
#     skips the whole compile (validated 74.5s -> 8.8s; 48.5s -> 6.0s as re-measured on vLLM 0.25.1 — the
#     ratio holds, the absolutes move per vLLM version). The cache is keyed to the no-MTP text graph; MTP
#     and image-heavy graphs differ, so those cold-compile regardless. OFF -> compile cold.
ENABLE_COMPILE_CACHE = True

# (3) FP8 KV CACHE — store K/V in fp8: ~half the KV memory, which is what lets the full 256K context fit
#     (6.53× concurrency on 96GB).  OFF -> default bf16 KV; 256K won't fit, so lower max_model_len.
#     This is independent of the NVFP4 *weight* format. NVFP4 KV is datacenter-Blackwell-only and crashes
#     on SM120 (vllm#43562), so FP8 remains the KV-cache dtype on RTX PRO 6000.
ENABLE_FP8_KV_CACHE = True

# (4) CUDA GRAPHS — the single biggest free decode win (~2.87x on Blackwell).  ON = no enforce_eager.
#     OFF -> enforce_eager=True (only to debug, or to fit spec-decode on a small GPU; see notes/).
ENABLE_CUDA_GRAPHS = True

# (5) SPECULATIVE DECODING (MTP) — env-settable, default ON. MTP is the biggest single-stream decode win
#     (NVFP4+MTP 121 tok/s vs 65 without). Its draft/verify overhead lowers throughput once the GPU is
#     saturated by many concurrent users (notes/BENCHMARKS.md §5). For high-concurrency deployments set
#     ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE=0 or try vLLM dynamic speculative decoding. ⚠ Needs the HF loader, so it turns
#     FAST MODEL LOADING off (vllm#42060).
ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE = os.environ.get("ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE", "1") == "1"

# (6) PREFIX-AWARE ROUTING — send a session's turns to the replica that cached its prefix. Keep OFF for the
#     single-user coding-agent trace used here: most requests share the same system prompts, skills, and
#     harness context, so round-robin still benefits from each replica's local vLLM prefix cache. Consider
#     enabling only for multi-user traffic with diverse byte-stable prefixes, then tune the imbalance knobs
#     so affinity does not overload one replica. Only matters with max_replicas > 1.
ENABLE_PREFIX_ROUTING = False

# DIRECT STREAMING is REQUIRED for this demo (Parts 1 & 2 connect Claude Code / Codex / Cursor straight to
# native /v1/messages + /v1/responses), so it is NOT a toggle — it's always on. It's enabled at the SERVICE
# level in the service YAML `env_vars` (RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_HA_PROXY + RAY_SERVE_LLM_ENABLE_DIRECT_STREAMING):
# the Ray Serve *controller* reads those at startup, while a runtime_env reaches only replicas (the deploy
# fails "ingress_request_router requires HAProxy" otherwise). Keep those two vars in the YAML — don't remove them.
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# MTP needs the HF loader, so turning spec decode on makes fast loading turn itself off (vllm#42060).
# It also has a distinct torch.compile graph with no prebuilt cache. Resolve both here so the env toggle
# needs no second edit.

# weights + FP8 KV / TP=1 / 256K, no-MTP text graph). Used when ENABLE_COMPILE_CACHE and MTP is off. vLLM
# caches in two dirs (inductor + AOT), restored to the two local paths below. Rebuild + new prefix if the
# image/GPU/flags (or compile graph, e.g. image input) change.
#
# The 0.23.0 prefixes are still in the bucket but are NOT usable here: 0.25.1 renamed the per-rank cache
# subdir from rank_0_0 to rank_0_0_dev0, so the old layout doesn't even match, let alone the cache keys.
# To rebuild after the next vLLM bump:
#   1. Deploy once with ENABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=False and ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE=0 (no-MTP text graph) and let the
#      replica compile cold. cache_dir is pinned to COMPILE_CACHE_DIR on this path (see below), which is
#      REQUIRED: the AOT artifact bakes in absolute inductor-cache paths, so a cache compiled under any
#      other cache_dir cannot be restored here.
#   2. Copy COMPILE_CACHE_DIR and COMPILE_CACHE_AOT_DIR off the REPLICA's node — not the head, which never
#      runs the engine.
#   3. `aws s3 sync` each to a new prefix named for the stack, then update the two *_S3 constants.
#   4. Update COMPILE_CACHE_AOT_DIR: the hash is derived from the compile config and DOES change across
#      vLLM versions (0.23.0 -> 0.25.1 moved it), so read it off the replica rather than assuming.
#   5. Set ENABLE_COMPILE_CACHE = True, redeploy, and confirm the restore in the replica log.
#
# The "-v2" suffix is not meaningful beyond history: a first 0.25.1 upload was compiled under the wrong
# cache_dir (see step 1) and is unusable. Drop the suffix on the next rebuild.

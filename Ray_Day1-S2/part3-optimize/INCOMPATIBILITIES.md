# Optimization Compatibility Notes

Read this before changing toggles in
[`serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py`](../serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py).

These findings were measured or root-caused on `qwen3.6-27b`, 1× RTX PRO 6000 96 GB
(`g7e.4xlarge`), `ray-llm:2.56.0-py312-cu130`, and vLLM 0.22.0–0.23.0. The service now runs
`ray-llm:2.57.0-py312-cu130` / vLLM 0.25.1; apart from the compile cache (rebuilt and re-measured there),
the conflicts below have not been re-reproduced on it, and the items the upgrade resolves outright are
called out inline. The current weight default is
`nvidia/Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4`; FP8 remains the KV-cache dtype. Full numbers are in
[`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md).

## Claude Code Compatibility

**Resolved on ray-llm 2.57.0.** Its vLLM 0.25.1 accepts Claude Code's Messages payload — including a
`system` role inside `messages[]` — so the `Containerfile` needs no vLLM override at all. For the record:
the 2.56.0 base shipped vLLM 0.22.0, which rejected that payload, and this tutorial pinned vLLM 0.23.0
(validated with Claude Code 2.1.201) to work around it. Anything below vLLM 0.23 still fails.

## Hard Incompatibilities

### 1. RunAI Streamer and MTP Spec Decode

`load_format="runai_streamer"` and MTP spec decode cannot both be on. The MTP drafter reloads weights
through the RunAI loader, which searches for `*.safetensors` in a streamer cache directory that has none.
The engine fails at init with:

```text
Cannot find any safetensors model weights ... model_streamer/<hash>
```

This is tracked in [vllm#42060](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/42060). The open fix PR #42079
does not resolve it in end-to-end testing.

Choose one:

- Default: enable MTP for ~1.86× faster NVFP4 single-stream decode and accept the slower HF loader.
- Optional cold-start path: keep RunAI Streamer for faster cold starts and turn MTP off.

The control panel automatically disables `ENABLE_FAST_MODEL_LOADING` when `ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE=True`.

MTP + CUDA graphs is coherent on RTX PRO 6000. The older `#40880` degenerate-output issue does not occur
here, so CUDA graphs can stay on with MTP.

### 2. MTP and the No-MTP Compile Cache

The prebuilt NVFP4 cache is keyed to the no-MTP text graph. MTP and image-heavy requests produce different
compile graphs, so they cannot reuse that cache. The control panel automatically disables
`ENABLE_COMPILE_CACHE` when MTP is enabled.

A torch.compile cache is also keyed to the exact vLLM version, and to the `cache_dir` it was compiled
under — the AOT artifact stores absolute paths into the inductor cache dir. The cache shipped here was
rebuilt on vLLM 0.25.1 under `COMPILE_CACHE_DIR`, which the serve file pins across the whole no-MTP path
for that reason. A mismatch on either axis is fatal, not a graceful miss: the engine raises
`FileNotFoundError` on `artifact_compile_range_*` and the service goes UNHEALTHY. Rebuild recipe is in
[`serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py`](../serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py).

### 3. Direct Streaming and Built-In Prefix Routing — resolved on ray-llm 2.57.0

On ray-llm 2.56, direct streaming plus Ray's built-in `PrefixCacheAffinityRouter` hung: the direct-streaming
ingress put the raw body in `pending_request.kwargs["request_body"]`, but that router only checked `args`, so
prefix routing never saw the request body. This repo shipped a `DirectStreamingPrefixCacheRouter` subclass to
parse that body.

[ray#64328](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/64328) made the ingress parse the payload for body-aware
routers and is in the 2.57.0 release branch, so `serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py` now wires up the stock
`PrefixCacheAffinityRouter` and the subclass has been deleted. On ray-llm 2.56.x, recover that adapter from
this repo's history.

Direct streaming is always on in this tutorial, so prefix routing has no other router option — but it stays
off by default (the single-user replay data does not need replica affinity), and the 2.57.0 path has not been
exercised end to end here.

## What Composes

This default set works together and is enabled in
[`serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py`](../serve_qwen3_6_27b_optimized.py):

- NVFP4 weights
- FP8 KV cache
- CUDA graphs
- MTP speculative decoding (`qwen3_next_mtp`)
- autoscale
- direct streaming
- tool calling (`qwen3_coder`)
- reasoning parser (`qwen3`)

With MTP off, the no-MTP NVFP4 text-graph compile cache composes with FP8 KV, CUDA graphs, autoscaling, and
direct streaming. The deliberate opt-ins are `ENABLE_FAST_MODEL_LOADING` and `ENABLE_PREFIX_ROUTING`. Fast
loading is useful when cold-start time matters more than decode speed; prefix routing depends on traffic
shape. See
[`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md) for the spec-decode numbers and the prefix-routing guidance.
